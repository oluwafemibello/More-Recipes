# More-Recipes
More-Recipes provides a platform for users to share the awesome and exciting  recipe ideas they have invented or learnt.  Suppose a user comes up with a recipe,  he/she can post it on More-Recipes and  get feedback in form of reviews and votes from other users who explore that recipe. Users can also keep a list of their favorite recipes on the application.
This project is broken down into challenges and completion of all phases would contribute greatly to my learning towards becoming a full-stack developer. Upon completion, I would have built a world-class full-stack (front-end and back-end) JS application.
